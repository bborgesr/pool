## A naive scheduler that can keep track of tasks and execute
## them in the right order (ex: a task set for 10 "millis" in
## the future will run after a task set for 5 "millis" in the
## future) -- provided that these are declared in a "protected"
## scope (see `protect` method). However, this scheduler has
## no notion of time and the `millis` parameter defines only
## the order of execution of the tasks, not *when* they are
## actually executed. This behaves eagerly: the tasks are
## executed as soon as possible (either immediately if
## `schedule` is called in an unprotected scope, or right
## after the execution of the `protect` function finishes).

## A helper class to NaiveScheduler that implements a simple
## reference counter. In our case, we initialize the reference
## counter by providing the NaiveScheduler's `executeTasks`
## function as the callback. Then, each time that
## `NaiveScheduler$protect` is called, we increment the
## RefCount's `count` variable by one. When we exit each
## `NaiveScheduler$protect` function call, we decrement
## the `count` variable by one. The callback (which is
## actually executing the scheduled tasks) is only called
## when the `count` vairable is 0 (i.e. when we're outside
## any call to `NaiveScheduler$protect`). This ensures that
## `NaiveScheduler$protect` functions as desired (see the
## comments in NaiveScheduler for more on that).
